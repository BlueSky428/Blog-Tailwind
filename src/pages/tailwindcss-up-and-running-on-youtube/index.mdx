Today we're excited to launch "Up and Running with Tailwind CSS", a beginner-level series of 8 videos that cover everything you need to know to get your start with Tailwind CSS.

<!--/excerpt-->

The "Utility-First Workflow" in Tailwind CSS is quite different from working with other CSS architectures. This video course takes you through your first steps: setting up a project with Tailwind CSS, getting comfortable with utility class composition, building responsive designs, customizing the framework.

It also adresses common concerns for newcomers by diving into key topics: removing classname duplication, extracting reusable components, optimizing for production.
